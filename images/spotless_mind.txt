CLEMENTINE
 Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
 I have a long trip ahead of me.
 (sits across aisle from Joel)
 How far are you going? On the train, I
 mean, of course. Not in life.

 JOEL
 Rockville Center. 

CLEMENTINE
 Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
 She stares at him. He gets uncomfortable.
 CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
 Do I know you?

 JOEL
 I don't think so.

 CLEMENTINE
 Hmmmm. Do you ever shop at Barnes and
 Noble?

 JOEL
 Sure.

 CLEMENTINE
 That's it. That's me: book slave there
 for, like, five years now. I thought I'd
 seen you somewhere.
 JOEL
 Really? Because --

 CLEMENTINE
 Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit
 right now.

 JOEL
 -- I go there all the time. I think I'd
 remember you.

CLEMENTINE
 Well, I'm there. I've seen you, man. I
 hide in the back as much as is humanly
 possible. You have a cell phone? I need
 to quit right this minute. I'll call in
 dead. I'll go on the dole like my daddy
 before me. Might be the hair.
