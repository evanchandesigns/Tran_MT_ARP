00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.040
NICOLE
You’re being so much like your

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
father.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.779
CHARLIE
DO NOT compare me to my father.

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:05.920
NICOLE
I didn’t compare you.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.230
I said you
were acting like him.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.230
120.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.230
CHARLIE
You’re exactly like your mother!

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.559
Everything you complain about her,
you’re doing.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.790
You’re suffocating
Henry.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.590
NICOLE
First of all, I love my

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.590
mother, she was a great
mother!

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.590
CHARLIE
I’m just repeating what

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.590
you’ve told me--

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.590
NICOLE
Secondly, how dare you compare my

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.590
mothering to my mother?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.420
I might
be like my father, but I’m NOT

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.420
like my mother.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.420
CHARLIE
You ARE!

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.860
And you’re like my
father.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.500
You’re also like MY
mother.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.800
You’re all the bad things
about all of these people.
