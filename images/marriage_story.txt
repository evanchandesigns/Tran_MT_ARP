NICOLE
You’re being so much like your
father.

CHARLIE
DO NOT compare me to my father.

NICOLE
I didn’t compare you. I said you
were acting like him.

CHARLIE
You’re exactly like your mother!
Everything you complain about her,

NICOLE
First of all, I love my
mother, she was a great
mother!

CHARLIE
I’m just repeating what
you’ve told me--

NICOLE
Secondly, how dare you compare my
mothering to my mother? I might
be like my father, but I’m NOT
like my mother.

CHARLIE
You ARE! And you’re like my
father. You’re also like MY
mother. You’re all the bad things
about all of these people.
